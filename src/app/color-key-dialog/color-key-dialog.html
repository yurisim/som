  <div class="color-gradient-container">
    <div class="color-box red"></div>
    <span>Needs Practice</span>
  </div>
  <div class="color-gradient-container">
    <div class="color-box green"></div>
    <span>Good Progress</span>
  </div>
  <p class="mt-4">The score is based on all questions in the section, including mastered and unanswered ones. Unanswered questions are counted as incorrect, so it's harder to get a green shade until you've attempted most of the questions.</p>
