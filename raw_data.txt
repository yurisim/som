•	Prohibited When: They compromise the chain of command, create perceptions of favoritism, involve improper use of grade for personal gain, are exploitative, or negatively impact the mission.
•	Responsibility: All members are accountable, but the senior member in a relationship is primarily responsible for maintaining professional standards.

07 – Critical Thinking 01
Summarize the definition of critical thinking.
 “The process of thinking carefully about a subject or idea, without allowing feelings or opinions to affect you.”

•	Raises vital questions and problems
•	Gathers and assesses relevant information.
•	Well-reasoned conclusions and solutions
•	Open-minded
Discuss methods for evaluating information.
Several methods for evaluating information involve distinguishing between different types of claims and information:
•	Statement vs. Argument: A statement that can be true or false. An argument provides a reason (or "premise") for a given conclusion.
•	Fact vs. Opinion: A fact is something true that can be proven and is objective and verifiable. An opinion is a subjective belief a person has formed that cannot be verified.
•	Objective vs. Subjective Claim: An objective claim is factually true or false, independent of what people think.  A subjective claim's truth or falsity depends on what people think.  
Explain the nine intellectual standards used in assessing one’s thinking.
Intellectual standards applied to thinking to verify the quality of information being presented or received. They are:

1.	Clarity: A "gateway standard" that is relevant to all others. If a statement is unclear, you cannot determine its accuracy or relevance.
2.	Accuracy: Addresses the validity and truthfulness of the information.
3.	Precision: Helps refine information by adding necessary details.
4.	Relevance: Evaluates what is most related to the issue at hand.
5.	Depth: Addresses the complexities and deeper layers of an issue.
6.	Breadth: Addresses various interpretations and other points of view.
7.	Logic: Ensures that thoughts are mutually supporting and make sense in combination.
8.	Significance: Identifies the most important pieces of an argument or issue.
9.	Fairness: Acts as a "gut check" to avoid personal interests, ego, and unjustified assumptions.
Explain cognitive domain operations and their relationship to disinformation.
•	Cognitive Domain Operations
•	Aims to influence an adversary's will, beliefs, and thinking to affect their decisions and actions.
•	Targets the human brain as the main combat space.
•	Uses psychological weaknesses like fear, anxiety, and suspicion to weaken the will to fight.
•	Aims to make an opponent feel "I can't," "I dare not," and ultimately "I don't want to".
•	Happens constantly, in peace and war, across political, economic, and social fields.
•	Information is the primary "ammunition," and social media is a main battleground.
•	Relationship to Disinformation
•	Disinformation is a key tool in cognitive operations.
•	Operations use cognitive interference, confusion, and information blocking to cause misjudgment.
•	Social media, AI, and deep fakes are used to spread disinformation and control narratives.
•	It exploits confirmation bias, where people favor information that confirms their existing beliefs, making them vulnerable to disinformation.
•	The goal is to control the "Three Powers": defining an event, dominating its process, and judging its outcome, often through spreading false or misleading information.
08 - Conflict Management
Describe sources of conflict (factors). 
•	Organizational Sources
•	Communication Factors: Misinterpreted, inaccurate, or incomplete information leading to frustration.
•	Structural Factors: Issues arising from the size of an organization, such as information distortion.
•	Rewards: Conflict can arise if reward systems are perceived as unfair or biased.
•	Resource Interdependence: Conflict is likely when resources like time, people, or money are perceived as scarce.
•	Personal Behavior Factors
•	Values: Conflict generated when personal values, such as those related to religion or politics, are questioned or criticized.
•	Perception: Different views on concepts like fairness or quality can cause conflict, especially when individuals assume everyone defines terms the same way.
•	Personality: Clashes can occur between uncomplimentary personalities, like a highly authoritarian person and someone with low self-esteem.
•	Additional Factors
•	Who you're dealing with: The approach to conflict may differ with a commander versus a subordinate.
•	What the stakes are: The importance of the issue to each party determines their level of assertiveness and cooperation.
•	What the situation is: Time-sensitive situations, like on a battlefield, may limit the available management styles.

Compare the five conflict management styles and problem-solving approaches.
The five conflict management styles from the Thomas-Kilmann model align closely with the five problem-solving approaches from the Air Force Negotiation Center (AFNC). Both models use two primary variables: one relating to assertiveness or task orientation, and the other to cooperativeness or people orientation.

Thomas-Kilmann	AFNC	Description
Competing/Forcing	Insist	- High assertiveness/task focus, low cooperation/people focus.
- Aims to overwhelm an opponent with authority or power.
- Useful when the objective is paramount, regardless of the relationship.
Avoiding	Evade	- Low assertiveness/task focus, low cooperation/people focus.
- A passive approach where the issue is often ignored or delayed.
- Appropriate when the issue is unimportant or more information is needed.
Accommodating	Comply	- Low assertiveness/task focus, high cooperation/people focus.
- Involves giving in to the other person's wishes to preserve the relationship.
- Useful when the relationship is more important than the task.
Compromising	Settle	- Moderate assertiveness/task focus, moderate cooperation/people focus.
- Seeks a solution that partially satisfies both parties through mutual concessions.
- A quick solution when parties are willing to give something up.
Collaborating	Cooperate	- High assertiveness/task focus, high cooperation/people focus.
- Aims to find a "win-win" solution that fully satisfies the concerns of both sides.
- Requires trust, openness, and shared information to create the best outcome.

09 - Critical Thinking II
Describe the elements of reasoning that are used in the critical thinking process. 
•	Purpose: The objective or goal of your thinking.

•	Assumptions: Beliefs and values that are taken for granted.
•	Inferences: The conclusions drawn from information and assumptions.
•	Implications & Consequences: The potential outcomes of a decision or action
Discuss common thinking errors that can lead to faulty thinking
•	Relying on System 1 Thinking: Using fast, instinctive, and emotional thinking instead of slow, deliberate, and logical System 2 thinking.
•	Asking the Wrong Questions: Failing to identify the correct problem or asking questions in a way that doesn't lead to understanding.
•	Thinking Too Quickly: Rushing to judgment without sufficient analysis.
•	Stereotypes: Making snap judgments and oversimplifications that prohibit critical thought.
•	Cognitive Biases:
•	Halo Effect: Allowing a single trait to define a whole person or situation.
•	Belief Perseverance/Confirmation Bias: Favoring information that confirms existing beliefs and perspectives.
•	Deflection: Answering the wrong question to steer a conversation away from its original intent.
•	Activated Ignorance: Actively using information that is false but mistakenly believed to be true.
